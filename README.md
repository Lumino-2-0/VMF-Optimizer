# VmfOptimizer

**Automatic face visibility and NoDraw optimization tool for Source Engine VMF maps.**  

VmfOptimizer analyzes `.vmf` map files and determines which brush faces are **visible to the player**.  
It automatically identifies **hidden or unreachable faces**, then suggests or applies the **`tools/nodraw`** texture to them â€” saving you hours of manual optimization in Hammer.
